# Ora

**Omniscient. Real-time. Autonomous.**

The framework for autonomous AI development with unified memory across all your tools.

## What is Ora?

Ora synchronizes Claude, Cursor, GitHub, Pinecone, LangSmith, and Slack into a single autonomous development system with omniscient memory. One heartbeat. Perfect sync.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Initialize a new project (coming soon)
ora-init my-project

# Your autonomous workforce is ready in < 5 minutes
```

## Architecture

- **Omniscient Memory**: Pinecone vector database maintains perfect context
- **PostgreSQL State**: Persistent agent state and decision history
- **File-based Communication**: Reliable agent coordination
- **15-Minute Oversight**: Daily strategic reviews, autonomous execution

## Status

🚧 **Under Development** - Cloned from production MCP-WP system (12+ agents, 2,426 vectors)
